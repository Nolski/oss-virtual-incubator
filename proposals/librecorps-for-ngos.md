### Title

<!-- A short, pithy title for the proposal. -->
LibreCorps for NGOs (this title is a work in progress)

### Short description

<!-- A short, one-sentence description of the proposal. -->
[Open@RIT](https://openr.it) is interested in helping solve a gap in the critical digital
infrastructure needed for humanitarian efforts. We hope to use our network of
contacts in humanitarian aid organizations and humanitarian open source
software development groups to provide student-powered open source community
development assistance to humanitarian aid initiatives. Like internship
programs such as Google Summer of Code, we would work with team members in
these humanitarian efforts as customer contacts to guide and shape the
engagements. It would differ from those existing programs focusing on projects
of a humanitarian nature and recruiting students with skill-sets more focused
on design, community development, and product management to provide those
services rather than software development. Another distinguishing factor is
that LibreCorps maintains oversight and long-term relationships rather than
merely acting as a marketplace and placement service.

### Proposal body

<!-- Explain your proposal. Add as much as you want, within reason! -->
The Rochester Institute of Technology is the leading academic education program
for undergraduates interested in Open Source. Within a year of its first course
offering, the program had established [a portfolio of offerings](https://opensource.com/education/10/3/course-co-op-lifecycle-openinnovationrit) for students
that included formal courses, experiential education, and internship
opportunities. These include the only academic minor in Open Source in the
world. From its very first class in creating educational games for the One
Laptop Per Child organization and platform, the focus was humanitarian work.
After a partnership with UNICEF Innovation that sent two RIT students to help
with [digital nation-building efforts in Kosovo](https://www.rit.edu/news/international-intelligence), RIT created LibreCorps, an
effort to brand humanitarian co-op opportunities. While successful, these
engagements with UNICEF and other NGOs have been intermittent depending on
either the RIT Open Source program or an NGO having funds to support work that
needed to be done.

Over the last few years, the LibreCorps effort has been evolving. In 2019,
UNICEF Innovation contracted with RIT’s LibreCorps program to provide a year
of [Open Source Community Mentorship](https://opensource.com/article/19/12/humanitarian-startups-open-source) for a cohort of their Venture Teams. In
2021, The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation awarded RIT’s new Open Programs Office,
Open@RIT, just under $500,000 to help stand up the effort and to create a
standing LibreCorps team (Full-Time staff member and rotating team of students
with skills in UI/UX, Project Management and Software Development) to drive
an [Open@RIT Fellowship Program](https://www.rit.edu/news/openrit-fellowship-program-supports-faculty-and-staff-open-projects) to aid faculty in preparing to attract, or
reinvigorating an existing, community around their research.

We look at the UNICEF contract and Sloan-funded Fellowship program as a
two-part pilot for what we now propose; the launch of a fully developed
LibreCorps unit that provides year-round Open Source Community consultancy and
mentoring to NGOs as its primary focus, with the ability to offer some
redevelopment and next-generation prototype development in service of that as a
secondary focus.

This program aligns with Open@RIT’s next evolutionary phase, a move away from
funded faculty mentorships (evolving that service to grant-supported work as
organizations like the NSF are also [beginning to support](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22572/nsf22572.htm) the kind of work we
have been doing for several years) to a focus on developing new programs. We
are applying for another two years of funding with the Sloan Foundation (with
their encouragement) to support this evolution, and half of the grant would be
to support the associate director, whose primary focus would be the development
of this effort as the first of an eventual portfolio of programs we envision
developing for Open@RIT over the next five years.

We are applying to the Plaintext group to provide the funding for the staff member, co-op students, and related expenses needed to work with the NGO clients of the consultancy.

### Due diligence

<!-- Please answer the following due diligence questions; it's okay to answer "N/A" if you don't know yet. -->
1. **What related work has already been done in this area?**

There are several internship efforts, some student-focused and others that look at a broader base, to increase engagement in Open Source. Primarily focused on software engineering roles, these efforts include Google Summer of Code, LFX Mentors, and Outreachy.

There are several undergraduate education courses around the country that have students learn Open Source practices while contributing to projects like Ushahidi, some of which can be found within the Teaching Open Source community

2. **How is this proposal innovative -- what distinguishes it from other related work?**
   1. Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS) projects often suffer a lack of…
      1. Communication and connection between users and creators, even in the case of open source projects due to a lack of technicality in most user bases
      2. Staffing to offer formal community management and recruitment, hampering development at all levels
      3. Technical cycles to address anything beyond core functionality, leaving R&D and upgrade efforts constrained
   2. While many HFOSS developers have great technical ability, they are often lacking in skills and time needed to develop and execute open source community strategies
3. **Who is your doer -- who will execute the proposed work?**
   1. Students hired through our LibreCorps program
   2. Staff to manage students and relations with partners
4. **How might this work be sustained long-term after an initial seed grant?**

A. Traditional Model, fee for service. Tends to be difficult to sustain in NGO circles

B. Corporate Sponsor Model: For Outreachy, corporate sponsors who support x number of students with some percentage of interns floating to work on a pool of FOSS projects and the rest working on sponsor projects. Its not clear that this would work in the NGO world, for example; would the UN Foundation be willing, or even allowed to do this type of donation where not all the funds contributed would go directly to their own projects?

C. “Public” campaign to make contributions to support efforts. Would likely attract only members of the public who work in tech. That said, there’s a lot of them.

D. UNICEF Innovation Fund Model. Endowment to establish long-term team capable of supporting X number of engagements per year. No risk once fund is established and then growth is achieved through adding new sponsors as in B.

### Resources needed

<!-- What resources are needed (grant money, advisors, expertise, etc.) to realize this proposal? -->
Grant funding for one full-time staff person, rotating team of three full-time employees interns, travel funds for dissemination and consulting meetings

### Other links and resources

<!-- Add any other links, images, or resources that are relevant to the proposal -->
The “resource” below provides some early thoughts on how to start up and then run the first two years of work.

**Pipeline Clients Plan**

[Open@RIT](mailto:Open@RIT) currently maintains relationships with a number of humanitarian open source projects such as Ushahidi, One Laptop Per Child, Etc, Etc. We also work with organizations such as UNICEF Innovation which invests in seed funding humanitarian technology projects and provides open source community strategy consultancy. Mike also brings with him a network of humanitarian aid workers from his time working in Jordan with the International Rescue Committee.

**Startup – Phase 1**

We hope to pre-select a list of eligible HFOSS projects which we have pre-vetted as having exhibited potential to benefit from development of more comprehensive community strategy. In combination with our pre-vetted projects, we will lay out a work plan for what is needed to develop a community strategy, hire students to execute on the necessary tasks, and begin on boarding project maintainers on incorporating community management into their workflow.

*Outline of primary objectives:*

* Pre-select projects to receive our services
* Pre-plan work to be completed by team of student interns
* Hire interns and complete initial community work & infrastructure
* Train existing team on integrating the newly designed community management & development strategies into workflow of core maintainers

**Continuation – Phase 2**

Once we have worked with an initial set of organizations, we will begin utilizing what we have learned from them (as well as previous work) to

* Develop pre-canned list of types of services that we can provide
* Create working group selection & evaluation committee driven by NGO partners
* Develop project submissions guidelines
* Structure our services to deliberately feed in to and allow better use of other open source sustainability projects.
  * Community development plan can help provide evidence for adoption of certain community infrastructures
  * Justify hiring and recruitment of non-software development specialists
